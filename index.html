    <!-- Step 1
        Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with 
        a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either 
        ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
        We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. 
        Tip: use the console to make sure this is returning the expected output before moving to the next step! 
    -->

    <!-- Pseudocode for Step 1
        1) Create let func called getComputerChoice 
        2) Inside function will be an array with three options, ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’
        3) Randomly select one of the options in that array
        4) Return the choice
    -->


    
    <!-- Step 2 
        Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. 
        The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - 
        and then return a string that declares the winner or tie of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

        Note:
        Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation). 
    -->

    <!-- Pseudocode for Step 2 
        1) Create function titled playRound()
        2) func will have two parameters, 'playerSelection' and 'computerSelection'
        3) create conditional that will return a string that declares the winner, loser or a tie
