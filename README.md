# rock-paper-scissors

Hello, this will be my attempt at The Odin Project 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' project, based of the Foundations Course

For this project, I will be creating a RPS game inside of the console.log(), as per the instructions found in TOP's site

I hope to complete this project within a week. I aim to improve my problem solving skills, along with my pseudocode skills
