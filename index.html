    <span>Hello!</span>

    <!-- Step 1
        Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with 
        a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either 
        ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
        We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. 
        Tip: use the console to make sure this is returning the expected output before moving to the next step! 
    -->

    <!-- 
        1) Create let func called getComputerChoice 
        2) Inside function will be an array with three options, ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’
        3) Randomly select one of the options in that array
        4) Return the choice
